## Welcome to Choirify

Choirify is a flexible multi-mode melody line voicer-harmonizer which can be used for a variety of applications: as an experimentation tool, artistic effect, choral writing aid, or anything we have not thought about yet.   
Choirify is implemented by using Processing for the GUI, and Supercollider as the backend. The GUI and the backend communicate with each other through OSC messages. If you're interested in the details, feel free to take a look at our complete [PDF report](report/The_Choirify_harmonizer_-_Always_one_more_note.pdf)!
